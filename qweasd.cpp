//Input: Prints a string into the console,                                      input("What's your name")
//       and asks the user for a string input.        

//Comments: Adding a # symbol in font of text                                   #This is a comment
//          lets you make comments on a line of code.                           print("This is code")
//          The computer will ignore your comments.

//Variables: A variable give a name to a piece of data.                         my_name = "Angela"
//          Like a box with a label, it tells you what's                        my_age = 12
//          inside the box.

// The += Operator: This is a convient way of saying:                           my_age = 12
//                  "take the previous value and add to it."                    my_age += 4   #my_age is now 16

// Integers: Integers are whole numbers.                                        my_number = 354

// Floating: Point Numbers                                                      my_float = 3.14159
//          Floats are numbers with decimal places.
//          When you do a calculation that results in
//          a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be
//          a floating point number.

// Strings: A string is just a string of characters.                            my_string = "Hello"
//          It should be surrounded by double quotes.

// String Concatenation: You can add strings to string to create                "Hello" + "Angela"
//                        a new string. This is called concatenation.           #becomes "HelloAngela"
//                        It results in a new string.


// Escaping a String: Because the double quote is special, it                   speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
//                    denotes a string, if you want to use it in                print(speech)
//                    a string, you need to escape it with a "\"                #prints: She said: "Hi"
